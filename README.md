# Multi-task learning in 3D cephalometry
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is based on my internship experience in Arts et Métiers ParisTech & Materialise France which combines two different tasks in one deep learning model for landmark localization as well as semantic segmentation based on 3D u-net architecture. Database in this project is private due to commitment.A jupyter notebook as an example is available in this repo. You can also find the report and presentation for this project in the repo. 



# Workflow

# example of results

1.metrics for landmarks localization: 
Euclidean distance: 1.69 ± 0.74 

2.metrics for semantic segmentation:
Pixel accuracy: 99%
Dice coefficient: 0.90
